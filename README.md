# CCC

This is a collection of my solution of [Canadian Computing Competition (CCC)](https://cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/computing.html).
The solutions are mainly written in C++. Python solutions will be updated gradually.

## Motivation

As starting to solving algorithmatic problem from LeetCode for seeking jobs, I didn't realize one day I would be in the hole of competitive programming deeply.
After I finished around 800 problems on LC, I feel like my body told me get the problems harder... Then I started to write Kick Start, Codejam, Codeforce, Hacker Cup
etc. And I luckily won a Codejam's T-shirt first time attending...

Finally, my coding skill was brought into teaching industry. I was asked if I could assist some young programmers on the coding and algorithm skills, and
definitely I am happy to be in. Now I am gradually clean up my solutions and post them here. Hope they're helpful!

## Contributing

Contribution on missing problems, optimization, simpifying code, and develop a remarkable different solution are more than welcomed. Just send PR and I will be active.
Thanks in advance.

## Testing

Test data could be found [here](https://cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/past_contests.html).

[DMOJ](https://dmoj.ca/problems/?search=CCC) has a mirror of CCC grader's test cases on all CCC problems. 

My test script is to be updated.

## Grade

Here listed the grade judged by myself and DMOJ. Since I don't have a CCC online grader account, I am not able to test on that platform. However, it will be much appreciated to help me test my code on CCC online grader platform.
