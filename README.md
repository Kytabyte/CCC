# CCC

This is a collection of my solution of [Canadian Computing Competition (CCC)](https://cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/computing.html).
The solutions are mainly written in C++. Python solutions will be updated gradually.

## Motivation

As starting to solving algorithmatic problem from LeetCode for seeking jobs, I didn't realize one day I would be in the hole of competitive programming deeply.
After I finished around 800 problems on LC, I feel like my body told me get the problems harder... Then I started to write Kick Start, Codejam, Codeforce, Hacker Cup
etc. And I luckily won a Codejam's T-shirt first time attending...

Finally, my coding skill was brought into teaching industry. I was asked if I could assist some young programmers on the coding and algorithm skills, and
definitely I am happy to be in. Now I am gradually clean up my solutions and post them here. Hope they're helpful!

## Contributing

Contribution on missing problems, optimization, simpifying code, and develop a remarkable different solution are more than welcomed. Just send PR and I will be active.
Thanks in advance.

## Testing

### Data

Test data could be found [here](https://cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/past_contests.html).

I put my data into `${year}/data/` folder. My following examples are based on this assumption.

### DMOJ

[DMOJ](https://dmoj.ca/problems/?search=CCC) has a mirror of CCC grader's test cases on all CCC problems.

### My Test Script

The `test.py` file is the my simple test script for checking the correctness of each question. Use `python3 test.py -h` to figure out the detailed usage.

- Requirement:
    - Python 3.6+ is required.
    - Linux works fine. Not tested for MacOS/Windows.

- Simple Usage: Pass `source-file`, `test-case-folder` and `language` arguments in. E.g.

    ```bash
    python3 test.py --source-file 2020/src/s4.cpp \
        --test-case-folder 2020/data/s4/ \
        --language cpp
    ```
    Supported languages are `cpp` and `py` for now.

- Other arguments:
    - Timeout option: use `--timeout` to specify the time limit to run each test case in seconds.
    Since the time limit is variant from CPU to CPU, please refer to the [How to set timeout](#How-to-set-timeout) section for details. The default time limit is 2 seconds.
    - For some numerical solution taking an answer as corrent when the difference
    between solution and answer is less than a threshold, use `--ans-threshold` argument. E.g. for 2020 s1, run

        ```bash
        python3 test.py --source-file 2020/src/s1.cpp \
            --test-case-folder 2020/data/s1/ \
            --language cpp \
            --ans-threshold 1e-6
        ```
    - For some questions do not have unique answer, I wrote a simple test script for each of them, at `year/test/problem.py`. Use `--test-file` argument to specify the test file. E.g. for 2019 s3, run

        ```bash
        python3 test.py --source-file 2019/src/s3.cpp \
            --test-case-folder 2019/data/s3 \
            --language cpp \
            --test-file 2019/test/s3.py
        ```

    - `--early-stop` to stop running the current test set when one case is failed. Default option is false.

#### How to set timeout

As the instructions in `example.cpp` to obtain the time limit you should set on your own computer. This is an estimation provided by CEMC officially.

**TL; DR;**

##### If your are using C++

- create a file called `in.txt` and write the following line into it.
    ```
    1
    11
    0
    ```
- Run following to compile
    ```bash
    g++ example.cpp
    ```
- Stopwatch the running time multiple times and use the `user` time for reference
    ```bash
    time ./a.out < in.txt
    ```

##### If your are using Python

- create a file called `in.txt` and write the following line into it.
    ```
    1
    9
    0
    ```
- Stopwatch the running time multiple times to estimate the time limit.
    Use the `user` time for reference
    ```bash
    time python3 example.py < in.txt
    ```

**Note**: From my personal observation using the c++ version to obtain the time limit is more accurate.

## Grade

Here listed the grade judged by myself and DMOJ. Since I don't have a CCC online grader account, I am not able to test on that platform. However, it will be much appreciated to help me test my code on CCC online grader platform.

**For Python code** It is clearly stated on the CCC official website that the problem is not designed to get full mark on all languages
even if an optimal solution is used, that is, for a scripting language like Python, it probably fail on some cases with large dataset.
However, a fairly good standing (not heading to CCO or IOI) can still be achieved with pure Python.
